# The following packages are required because they're either build
# tools or are dependencies only if the "csi" package is already
# generated. However, if the "csi" package is removed (a valid
# condition), a "dep ensure" will not fetch the dependencies it
# no longer sees in the project's dependency graph. Including the
# dependencies in the "required" list ensures they're always
# downloaded.
